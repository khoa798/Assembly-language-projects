# CE12---Assembly
A showcase of my learnings with embedded programming with assembly language.
Here you will find a few simple files:

1) Caesar Cipher(LC3)
    Creating a caesar cipher from the LC3 assembly language. This was tested and run using a simulator for the LC3.
  This program first begins by saying hello and prompting the user for an offset amount to create their cipher.
  Then the program asks if the user would like to (E)ncrypt, (D)ecrypt, or e(X)it. A fun but time intensive program
  that required knowledge of how computers work on a deeper level.
   

2) Introduction to Uno32 and MIPS
      This neat program is the first of my embedded programming experiences. It reads in the values of switches and buttons on an UNO32, then turns on their respective LEDs. It uses the MIPS assembly language to correctly read in and output the respective values to the hardware. A nice introduction to MIPS and its many advanced features over the LC3.

3) Decimal to Binary Converter(MIPS)
  a more advanced approach to understanding MIPS and its many features. This nice program reads in a string from memory and converts decimal values to binary. The program then stores it back into a string as an ASCII value, but printing a binary representation of decimal integers.
